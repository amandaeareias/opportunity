# Opportunity
Platform that connects people who want to volunteer with nonprofit organizations that need volunteers.  
[Live demo here](https://bit.ly/2uByUoy). ü§∏‚Äç

## Idea
In most cities, there are usually two or three famous NGOs that everyone knows. It happens a lot that, when someone wants to start volunteering, they usually go to one of those famous NGOs because they don‚Äôt know any other options, while hundreds of other organizations - that don‚Äôt have the same visibility, marketing, appealing website - still need help. **Opportunity** is an attempt to solve this problem, an online environment where small and local nonprofit organizations can get the visibility they need, and people willing to help can find local, small NGOs to work with and help making the world a better place.
